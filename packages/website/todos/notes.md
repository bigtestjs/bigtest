- need the svg icons for reach out on the bottom of landing page (see png file in this folder)
- setup email submission via netlify (components/subscribe.js)
- refactor with styled components (wip)
- need to refactor for dark mode? this might mean we need to hard code the svg's into the pages so the color of the icons can switch (as it is on frontside.io)
- commented out 'API' in navbar for now until we finish docs
- fix links in navbar
